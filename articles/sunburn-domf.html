      <h1> SUNBURN by Dominic Fike: Sing or Skip? </h1>
      <hr>
      
      <p>Many people know Dominic from his popular songs like "Babydoll" or "3 Nights" but this man is SEVERLYYY-, PAINFULLYYYYY underrated. On July 7, 2023 Dom dropped the most PERFECT album for the summer. With a perfect mix of slow, mellow beats and upbeat, guitar shredding melodies, it creates a perfect vibe for any day, any activity, ANYTHING.</p>
      
      <p>In my opinion, Dominic is one of the very fewwww artists in my music library who has absolutely no skips 
        across his whole discography. This album alone put him in my top 5 artists, easy. Not to mention he's one 
        of the kindest, most down to Earth artists I've ever come across. He's also GORGEOUS (Dom, if you're reading this, 
        call me). ANYWHO, let's start this album reviewðŸ˜‹. </p>
      
       <h2>How Much Is Weed?</h2> 
      <p> The opening track for an album 
        is the song that sets the tone for the whole album. It's the thesis
         statement of an album, grabs the listeners attention. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS SONG DOES. It has an amazing initial mellow but intricate beat that grabs your attention and isn't really repetitive which can be rare to find in music today. The flow in which he says his words is so pleasing to the ears and it leaves you wanting more. Sort of mysterious in a way. This is the type of song you'd listen to on a long train ride and you'll feel like an angsty, misunderstood main character. </p> -->
      
      <h2>Ant Pile</h2>
      <p>This song is so adorable to me and is one of my favorites on this album. Telling the story of two childhood best friends growing in maturity and realizing that they have feelings for eachother. After knowing someone for so long, you've seen them in  all their tough times, at their most vulnerable points, you know them like the back of your hand. It really just shows the vibe change from just being besties to eventually becoming something more.  </p>
      
      <p>This is such a beautiful thing to me because when you've known someone for such a long period of time, you're well aware of their imperfections but you actively choose to love them and spend time with them despite that. When you meet someone new and start to develop feelings, it takes you years to actually *know* that person. But when it's a prior friend, you already truly know who they are and you start to love the quailities that you loved before, just in a different, more inimate way.</p>

      <h2>Think Fast feat. Weezer</h2>
      <p>The initial tone to this song is very monotone and dark but during the pre-chorus it starts to pick up a more bright tone. The message Dom is sending through this song is that life can be confusing sometimes and you have to  <mark>"think fast" </mark> at times because he believes you only have one try at this life so you have to make the most of it while you can. I liked that he talked about how confusing life can be and you can be pushed and pulled to think or do so many different things and he just is trying to do the right thing, whatever that may be, sitting down and resting or jumping around and doing a bunch of different things.  </p>

        </div>
      </div> -->
      
      <h2>Sick</h2>
      <p>Honestly the lyrics in this song are pretty self-explanatory. Dom is talking about an ex who he still has feelings for, so much so that it makes him sick to be around them and think of the memories that they shared. No matter how much he tries to detach from her and the memories, he still loves her to the point where he's genuinely is irritated by it. He can't even try to be friends with her because he'll just be overwhelmed with memories. </p>
      
      <h2>7 Hours</h2>
      <p> This song shows a little bit of vulnerability. Talking about having insecurity in a relationship, not knowing if you mean as much to your significant other as they mean to you. This shows in the chorus where it says: 
        <br>
        <mark> <br>
      "Seven-hour drive just to get beside you <br>
      And I treat it like life or death <br>
      Won't do twenty-five to life just for killing time with me <br>
      So, could you treat me like I'm worth it?" <br></mark>
        <br>
       In these verses Dom decribes how far we would go for his lover without even giving it a second thought about it and he feels like he has to convince his significant other that he's worth the effort that's being put into the relationship. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Sighhh, it's okay Dom. It happens to the best of us. I've been there tooðŸ˜ª.</p>
      
      <h2>Dancing In The Courthouse</h2>
      <p> This upbeat, fun song really is the essence of the saying "you're in charge of your own story". Dom talks in this track about how our outlook on a situation or our life can greatly impact how we react to things or how things turn out for us. So if we try to act positively, we can make things at least a little bit better for ourselves. Also not allowing outside influences to determine how we feel about things, especially ourselves. One verse I especially liked was: <br>
      <mark>"We make our problems fade by facin' 'em"</mark>
        
        <br>
        He is absolutely right, the more you avoid a problem and leave it unaddressed, the bigger and more serious it's going to get. So you might as well get it out of the way while you can and you'll feel so much better afterwards. Wise words from Dominic :).
      </p>

      <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
      <p>THISSSS SONG RIGHT HEREEE!!! When I tell you this song is CONSTANTLY on repeat for me, oooo girl. I love this song so much. It's easily my favorite song, not only on the album. From the funky beat, the lyrics, HIS VOICE. Perfection. Most of you might recognize this song from the new "Spiderman: Across The Spiderverse" movie when Gwen and Miles were swinging through the city (great movie by the way but we review music here, not movies), funny enough though, I didn't pay any attention to this song in the movie, but we found eachother later on (we were meant to be clearly).  </p>
      
      <p>This song really captures how much someone runs through your mind when you fall head over heels for someone. You see their face and hear their voice everywhere you turn. You can't turn down the thoughts of them in your mind. No matter how much you try to stay away from them or how wrong they may be for you, you'll still always leave that opening for them to come through whenever they please.  </p>
      
      <p>Fun fact: Dom said at one of this concerts that he actually didn't like this song that much at first and he was shocked when he saw that people really liked it. "Why didn't he like it" you ask? I couldn't tell you brother, it's a masterpiece (pun-intended.. again).  </p>
      
      <h2>Bodies</h2>
      <p> This track here shows what a beautiful soul Dom is. For the girlies whose love language is words of affirmation (*cough* me), this song is for you, my loves. This song is talking about his partner who has a kid and has made some pretty bad decisions in her past or has possibly been taken advantage of. Dom reassures his partner that her past doesn't define her and it doesn't matter to him or will make him treat her differently because of it. The verse: <br>
        <mark>
          "It's okay, baby, we can start fresh today"
        </mark> <br>
        shows that his significant others past can finally be left there and they each can have a fresh, clean slate. We love a reassuring king.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Sunburn (Title track!)</h2>
      <p>Sunburn talks about what Dom's life was like where he grew up in Naples, Florida, and nods a little bit to the time that he spent in jail back in 2017, (only the real ones know about that fact). While listening to this song and reading the lyrics, it's very clear that Dominic didn't have it easy at all. It makes mention of <mark> "babies having babies and the baby daddy not being in the picture"</mark>, <mark> "mama went to jail and we were left hungry" </mark>, <mark>"not having the money for school" </mark> , and the fear of <mark> "losing it all"</mark>. I love how transparent this song is, showing that this is real stuff that people go through and have to deal with. It's also nice to see someone who made it out of that type of life, not forgetting where they came from. Lots of people, when they make it big, they don't talk about how rough they had it before when it can actually be inspiring to people in the same situation, seeing that they can rise above it and not be stuck in the same toxic cycle they seem to be stuck in/bound to. Definitely another favorite of mine. </p>
      
      
      
      <h2>Pasture Child</h2>
      <p>Did you have a childhood crush? You know who I'm talking about, they may cross your mind from time to time and you just reminisce at how young and innocent the attraction you had to them was. The longing you had for them when they were away and the butterflies you felt when they were around. Turns out Dominic has had the same experience. (Side note: I love how relatable this man's music is. Relatable music just feels like tightest, safest hug in the world).</p>
      
      <p>Anywho, taking a look at the lyrics of this song, it's clear that the story starts in Dom's childhood-, maybe late 90's or early 2000's with the mention of him and this girl talking through a landline. He describes her as a very modest girl who seemed to live in a very structured household, where it was lights's out and no TV was allowed after 9PM, but they would still sneak and talk to eachother on the phone when she was supposed to be sleeping. It later goes on to talk about how her life turned out as an adult. Her being a successful author who has evidently put her childish infatuation toward Dom behind her by the fact that he didn't make the cut for her book. He admits that he still will call her from time to time, but she's not as determined to answer his calls anymore. He takes the rest of the time to reminisce about the time they spent together as children and how it made him feel. (Don't worry Dom, I can't let go of the past either. We out here. It makes sense why this is also one of my favorites.) </p>
      
      <h2>4x4</h2>
        <p>This is a slower paced song, which is very fitting. It gives you time to actually *listen* to what he's saying, not just hearing the beat and the flow of his words and getting swept away in that. Taking the time to actually absorb what the words are telling you. In this song Dom talks about spending your entire life searching and longing for a fairytale type of love, the type of love where prince charming just appears and is supposed to sweep you off your feet and you live happily ever after but it all ends up <mark>"only being apart of the lie"</mark>. In the chorus, he asks himself the question <mark>"if you could stay, would you go?"</mark>  He asks himself this question to reflect on his thinking. If he wasn't forced to think outside of this "fairytale" illusion of love that has felt so familar to him, would he go back to thinking the way he did before? And if he took the chance to think outside of it, does that mean it wasn't actually important or real to him in the first place? </p>
      
      <h2>Frisky</h2>
      <p>Right off the bat, in the first five seconds you're slapped in the face with this BEAUTIFUL riff played on the guitar. 10/10, absolutely love it, "Frisky" is clearly another favorite of mine. This song is about relationship where Dom is putting a lot of effort into this person, wanting to help them through their problems, and longing a deeper connection with this person that is seemingly very disconnected and <mark> "messy-headed"</mark> as Dominic describes them. It's very evident that Dom is trying everything to try to make this person listen, trying to get them to understand that their problems are temporary. And I know what you're thinking: "How the heck does feeling 'frisky' relate to this situation??" Yes, I'm aware that it wouldn't be the first adjective I would use to describe how I'd feel in this situation but in this context, 'frisky' would relate to wanting a deeper, more exciting connection with someone. </p> 
      
      
      <H2>Mama's Boy</H2>
      <p>Alright y'all, buckle up. I got a LOT to say about this song right here, these lyrics NEED to be talked about immediately.</p>
      
      <p>For a little bit of backstory, Dominic has talked in other songs before about issues he's faced with his parents, their struggle with addiction/substance abuse and having to serve time in prison.. but this song is much deeper than the problems experienced with his parents (more specifically, with his mother in this song), it's about the feeling of not being *loved* by his mother. He often felt abandoned by his parents and as if he didn't have any real significance in their lives. </p>
      
      <p>In the chorus, Dominic expresses his desire of <mark> "wishing he was a toy" </mark>. A toy is something used for entertainment, suggesting that he still has a desire to please his parents in some way or another. Wanting them to notice him and allow him to be useful to them. </p>
      
      <p>A verse that really stands out to me is: <mark>"Half of my heart is in your chest"</mark>. It's such a beautifully worded, thought invoking verse. Coming from someone who also has had similar issues with their mother, it's very bittersweet to remember that you still share pieces of them that are impossible to get rid of. You try to hard to detatch from them in any way you can but there are some things you physically can't leave behind. The blood you share, inherited personality traits, aspirations that they've passed down to you. Knowing that half of their DNA is coursing through your veins is so intimate yet so infuriating. The person who has caused you the most hurt will always be connected to you and there's nothing you can do to change it. It's wild to think about, really. </p>

      </div> -->
      
      <h2>Dark</h2>
      <p>Dark is another very, very, very vulnerable song written by Fike about this thoughts
         going through rehab and his relationship with his parents. He talks about how these 
         thoughts/feelings of blandness and melancholy <mark> "leaves like sunburn and comes like rain"
           </mark>. Sunburn tends to fade pretty quickly, but always comes back and rain always starts very suddenly, is always very dark and gloomy for a while but never stays forever. He mentions that he thought that things would be different after treatment, maybe that all his problems would go away. He still acknowledges his accomplishment, saying <mark> "I stood up to a demon, mama you shoulda seen it."</mark> Showing that he still is searching for that outside approval from his mother he's been missing his whole life. </p>
      
      <p>He brings up a memory of his little brother, Alex, not having <mark> "his two front teeth" </mark>. He does this in an attempt to hang on to the innocence of his childhood in a way, not allowing his bad thoughts to fully engulf him by grasping onto innocent memories of his youth. </p>
      
      <h2>What Kinda Woman</h2>
      <p>Last song of the album! Making a very mellow exit from the album and the stories told in these songs. This final song talks about a woman who seems to make things more difficult for those that she loves. She is described to be a possibly misunderstood, saying that people <mark> "could learn a lot from her"</mark> in response to being ask <mark>"what makes you so cruel?" </mark>After wondering why this woman is the way she is, in the outro it's said that <mark> "I see you noticing me in a new light"</mark>. Finally they are able to see eachother in a way they didn't see eachother before, understanding one another a bit more.  </p>
      
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p> This album is an absolute favorite of mine and taking the time to analyze each song really made my appreciation
         for it grow deeper. Seeing someone have the ability to be vulnerable and share their inner feeling and thoughts and 
         put that out into the world is so amazing to me. There's nothing better to me than music that came straight from someone's 
         life and put onto paper. If I haddd to pick my one top favorite song from this album, I think I would have to give it to "Mona Lisa",
          I genuinely cannot get enough of this song. Thank you so much for taking the time to read what I had to say about this album and I 
          can't wait to see what Dominic has in store for future albums!</p>
