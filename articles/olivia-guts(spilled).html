      <h1>
        Guts by Olivia Rodrigo: Album Review üíú
      </h1>

      <hr id="2">

      <p>"I know, I KNOW!" Look, I know what you're thinking: "Lily, you sat and wrote an entire article on how 
        Olivia supposedly has copied multiple of Conan Gray's songs. Why are you putting in the energy to write a review
        on her most recent album?" I never said I hated the girl, she makes bangers that I enjoy on a day to day basis. Some of 
        those bangers just happened to be stolen. Not my problem, I just talk about what I notice. Now let me tell you all about
        this lovely album in peace.
      </p>

      <p> In my opinion, I actually like this album so much more than SOUR. Even though that was also a veryyy good album for it's time. I feel like
        this entire album ties in so beautifully together and really encompasses the girly teenage ansty that comes with being a teenage girl. This album 
        is a comforting mix of songs you can jump around to, scream, and cry to all within the hour and 5 minutes that it runs.
      </p>

      <h2>all-american... girl üòÅ (we have pure mouths on my blog)</h2>

      <p>I remember when I first listened to this album back when it came out back in September, I didn't like this song that much. Which, if you'll
        know anything about my music-listening habits, you'll know that before I learn to love something, I have to hate on it at least a little bit first.
        I'm not exactly sure what I didn't like about it listening to it now.. guess we'll neva know *insert kanye award show meme here*. 
      </p>

      <p> The build up of the whole song is so FUN. It starts off with a refreshing melody played on the guitar. Mentioning 
        things like being <mark> "light as a feather and a still as a board" </mark> and being <mark> "built like a mother and a total machine" </mark> which ties together
        because of her expectation to tend to multiple different audiences because of her Disney Kid background but also being her true, authentic self
        within her music. Other lines like <mark> "I've got sun coming outta my pockets, best believe" </mark> give her this image of somehow being
        eternally optimistic no matter the circumstances. 
      </p>

      <P>Many other lines in this song paint her as this picture perfect girl, who's always calm and happy until the build up when this all
        really shows how she believes she *should* act/portray herself as in order to be taken seriously and not be put into this profile of
      only being this ignorant, moody teenage girl. But even in doing that shes told to "act her age". So no matter what she's either acting
    "too grown" for her age or that she needs to "grow up" due to being in an industry run and flooded with adults so she says <mark> "I know
       my age and I act like it" </mark> . The frustration of this shows in the eventual climax close to the end of the song where she screams, while still having to bring it back down to a much softer tone
during the last couple of verses. </P>

<h2>bad idea right?</h2>

<p>I absolutely love this song so much</p>
