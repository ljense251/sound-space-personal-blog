<h1>
  Conan Gray & Olivia Rodrigo: Mutualism or Parasitism?
</h1>
<hr id="2">

<p>
  Olivia and Conan! Pop cultures favorite besties, right? Yes, at first glance they seem like a two peas in a pod,
   but when you take a closer look at their music history, it seems as if their discography is weirdly similar.
    Then when you think *harder* about who entered the industry first, it gets weirder. Lets take a look at this 
    friendship and discuss whether this friendship is *truly* mutual, or if Miss Rodrigo has some other motive behind her friendship.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Before I begin, I would just like to say that I actively listen 
  to both Conan and Olivia and think they're both very, very talented in what they do. 
  And with the topic of this article being dicussed, we should keep in mind that both Olivia and Conan share the same
   producer, Daniel Nigro, so there are bound to be some similarities within their works. Now that we got that out of the way,
    let's being the anaylizing!</p>

<h2> Do you get deja vu?</h2>
<p>
  If you've looked at any form of music entertainment in the past 2 years, you have heard the name "Olivia Rodrigo". She is known for her moody teenage pop music and her relatable lyrics within her songs. But before Olivia's music career took off with "driver's license" in 2021, there was another artist pulling on our heart strings: the one and only, Conan Gray. 
</p>
<p>
  There are a few songs with similiarities between the two artists that catch my eye. First, "The Story" by Conan and "hope ur ok" by Oliva, "Heather" and "lacy", and "Lookalike" and "deja vu". The story (hehe, pun intended) that these songs tell are extremely similar and even the lyricism within each of these songs are very alike. Also, I would like to point out that Conan released his albums before Olivia came out with her albums. Are the parallels between these songs a coincidence? 
</p>

<h2>"The Story" & "hope ur ok"</h2>

<p>
  Both of these songs obviously talk about past friends of Conan and Olivia who they seemed to have lost contact with. All of these friends dealt with personal problems, specifically self-identification and family issues. The main message of the lyrics are to tell these friends "stories", reaching out to them in a sense. Showing that they had not been forgotten by their past friends and that they wish them the best even though their circumstances hadn't been ideal. 
</p>

<p>
  "The Story" made its first appearance on March 20, 2020 on Conan's debut album, "Kid Krow". Ironically, "hope ur ok" came long after "The Story" on Olivia's debut album, "SOUR", on May 21, 2021. It's not outlandish to say that Olivia may have possibly had a similar experience with her childhood friends to Conan, it's very possible. It is odd though to release a song with nearly IDENTICAL experiences and lyrics to a song that came out a little over a year later than Conan's. 
</p>

<h2>"Heather" & "lacy"</h2>

<p>Ahhhh jealousy, jealousy. Everyone get's jealous from time to time and sometimes there comes along that single person who seems to get everything you want and leaves you with nothing in return. So much so that it seems like they may be doing in on purpose, but they're so perfect that it leaves you with no tangible proof in order for you to yank the rug of flawlessness from underneath them. We've all been there, unless you're Lacy or Heather, of course.  </p>

<p>
  Everyone remembers the 3rd of December when Conan wore "your sweater" and he watched your eyes follow as Heather walked by. From that moment forward, "Heather" became the girl that everyone wanted to be, the girl who always got the guy in the end, the prettiest girl who got to wear "your sweater". Of course you'd think I'd be easy to hate Heather, she took your man simply by walking past him but she was too much of an angel for you to hate her, not even with one fiber of your being. No matter how insecure she made you in return, you only wished you could be her rather than hate her. It's safe to say that "Heather" and "lacy" are neck in neck in this feeling of envy you'd feel towards them. Lacy is described as this "angel", with ribboned hair, that seems to be able to get the single thing that Olivia wanted. Sound familiar? Of course it seems that Olivia was more fed up Lacy than Conan was with Heather but it's a similar story nonetheless. 
</p>

<h2>"Lookalike" & "deja vu"</h2>

<p>These songs are a classic "you'll see me in everything" type of break-up song. Both talking about an Ex moving on to someone who ends up being veryyyy similar to yourself (hmm, ironically like these songs are similar to eachother). "Lookalike" was released in one of Conan's earlier EP's on November 16, 2018 while "deja vu" was realeased on "SOUR" along with "hope ur ok" in May of 2021. Miss Olivia took her time with this one I see. </p>

<p>
  A point that is made in each of these songs is that the ex-significant other will try to hide the fact that they moved on to someone to someone similar to yourself, but it ends up being extremely obvious to everyone else that there's nothing originial about this new person that came along. The similar names, the same playlists being played, the same look in their eyes as you have. Copy and paste. 
</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
  After everything we've been over in this article, I think it's safe to say there are some heavy parallels within these two musicians songs for sure. We can't say for sure that Olivia inherently copied Conan's work and that they "aren't really true friends". We don't see how close they are when all the cameras are away and behind closed doors. We will never know all the facts, but it's interesting to delve into.
